# Zesty Unity SDK

The Zesty Unity SDK allows you to integrate a Zesty banner into your project. It is compatible with desktop, mobile, and WebGL projects, both flatscreen and immersive.

## How to use this Unity package

1. Drag the ZestySDK.prefab into your scene.
2. Be sure to have at least one main camera tagged.
3. Drag the Banner prefab into your scene.
4. Fill in your space ID and creator ID (aka your wallet address).
5. Select the appropriate format for your banner based on what your space is listed as.
   1. The banner will automatically scale itself in order to keep the correct aspect ratio. This will apply in Edit mode whenever you change formats or adjust the width of the banner.
6. Select your desired style for the default banner when no campaign is active for your space.
